## Story

This is a tool that went from idea to its current state _entirely in one afternoon_. 

I don't really have time to work on it so I hope it works for you if you encounter this repo :D

Things that need to improve:

- [ ] Images
- [ ] Code blocks (should be a matter of making a minor change to the `turndown` dependency)
- [ ] Probably a lot of other stuff?
